        "Two Hearts Charitable Trust is the fruit of a sacred vision planted in the hearts of the Poor Daughters of the Crowned Virgin (DCV Sisters)—a religious congregation founded by Venerable Teresa Fardella de Blasi in Italy. Deeply moved by the suffering of the poor, the sick, and the abandoned, Teresa Fardella dedicated her life to compassionate service rooted in faith and love.",
        "Her legacy lives on through the DCV Sisters, who continue her mission across the world. Inspired by her spirit, the Two Heart Charitable Trust was established to extend this mission in India, particularly through acts of mercy, health care, and empowerment.",
        "Named after the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary, the Trust embodies a twofold love: one that heals and one that consoles. It brings together medical professionals, caregivers, volunteers, and people of goodwill to serve the suffering with dignity, hope, and care.",
        "Our first initiative, the Teresa Fardella Palliative and Hospice Centre at Elamakkara, Kochi, offers professional and affordable palliative care to the terminally ill. It is a living tribute to the legacy of our foundress—a home where every person is respected, comforted, and accompanied with love until the end of life.",
        "As we grow, we remain guided by Teresa Fardella’s example and the call to 'serve Christ in the poor and suffering', continuing her legacy in our time.",
